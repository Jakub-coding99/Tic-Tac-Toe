# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe against AI

## Functions

- Single-player game
- AI can block the user's move and search for winning combinations
- Detects draws, winners, and offers the option to restart the game
- Play by entering a number from 1 to 9


## AI
The AI uses a simple strategy:
- If it can win, it plays the winning move
- If the user can win, it blocks the user's winning move
- If possible, it starts by taking the center of the board
- If the center is taken, it tries to take a corner
- Otherwise, it chooses a random available field
